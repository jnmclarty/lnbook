# Lightning Applications (LApps)

The lightning network can transmit payments and data.
This combination enables the establishment of new standards and protocols where the transmission of value and business logic can be strongly coupled.
Lightning node operators can deploy turing complete code along with their lightning network client of choice.

LApps are developed by combining a set of arbitrary software components with at least one component which interacts with the lightning network protocol.

There is a growing list of use cases for lApps which includes but is not limited to payment processing, [wallets](https://zaphq.io/), [tipping](https://github.com/ElementsProject/nanotip), [trading](https://pro.kollider.xyz/) and digital-good order fullfilment.
The most novel forms of lApps surround [streaming payments](https://socket.money/) and [streaming delivery of services](http://andyschroder.com/DistributedCharge/).

A live index of lApps is being maintained [here](https://dev.lightning.community/lapps/) and [here](https://kriptode.com/).

Resources for Lapp developers include:

* [Polar](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lapps/guides/polar-lapps) helps developers quickly setup development and test networks
* [Lightning Charge](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning-charge) is a drop-in replacement for accepting lightning payments
